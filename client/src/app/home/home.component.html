<h1>freeCodeCamp Projects</h1>
<p>
  I recently made the decision to revist and update all of my projects submitted
  for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
</p>
<p>
  Many of my existing projects were either outdated (failing tests due to
  changes we made in the curriculum) or no longer hosted.
</p>
<p>
  These are the new projects, written using the MEAN stack. This list will be
  updated as projects are completed.
